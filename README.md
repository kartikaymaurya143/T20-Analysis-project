# T20-Analysis-project

##This project aims to leverage the capabilities of Pandas and Power BI to analyze T20 cricket data and identify the best 11 players for an unbeatable team.
The project commences by sourcing reliable and comprehensive data from official cricket databases and APIs, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the dataset. The collected data is then processed and cleaned using Pandas, a powerful Python library, to facilitate effective data manipulation and preparation.
Employing Pandas, an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, encompassing statistical analysis, visualization, and correlation exploration. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as batting averages, strike rates, bowling figures, and other relevant metrics are analyzed to quantify player performances.
Through the integration of Power BI, a dynamic and interactive data visualization tool, the insights derived from Pandas are visually represented in intuitive dashboards and reports. This enables stakeholders to easily navigate through the analyzed data, apply filters, and derive actionable insights with ease.
